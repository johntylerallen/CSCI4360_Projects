For Project II, two datasets were examined in which both have a target variable.
The goal of the project was to create a 2, 3 and 4 layer neural network for each 
dataset in Python (Scala files omitted). 

R-sqaured-bar and R-squared-cross-validted were the metrics used to pick an optimal
model. In addition, a comparison using and not usingforward feature selection before
feeding each dataset was examined.

A summary is included for each dataset which includes all results 
obtained. A short report was also included to provide exploratory data analysis
and a discussion and conclusion of the results.
