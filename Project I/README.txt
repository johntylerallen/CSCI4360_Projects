For Project I, two datasets were examined in which both have a target variable.
The goal of the project was to create the following regression modeling techniques 
in two programming languages (Python and Scala) with the use of feature selection
(forward, backward, stepwise (scala) and recursive (Python):
	- Regression
	- Ridge Regression
	- Lasso Regression
	- Quadratice Regression
	- Symbolic Regression (in scala files, Symoblic Ridge and Symbolic Lasso as well)
R-sqaured-bar and R-squared-cross-validted were the metrics used to pick an optimal
model. A summary is included for each dataset which includes all results 
obtained. A short report was also included to provide exploratory data analysis
and a discussion and conclusion of the results.

scala files have been omitted.
